# Overview

This program is designed to mimic a real arcade where users can play games. The program has 4 classes: Main, arcade, guessNumGame, and User.
The program allows users to play a game (guess number game) and choose whether play it alone or play it with more people. The program also allows users to create a report of the game.

# Future Work

- I would like to make the program give users the option of choosing among a couple of games.
- I would like to read and write to a file to display global scores.
- I would like to add a function that checks if a player already exists and give users the choice to choose an existing player.
